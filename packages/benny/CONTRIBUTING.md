## Getting started

**What does "contributing" mean?**

Creating an issue is the simplest form of contributing to a project. But there are many ways to contribute, including the following:

- Updating or correcting documentation
- Feature requests
- Bug reports

## Issues

Please only create issues for bug reports or feature requests. Issues discussing any other topics may be closed by the project's maintainers without further explanation.

Do not create issues about bumping dependencies unless a bug has been identified and you can demonstrate that it effects this repo.
